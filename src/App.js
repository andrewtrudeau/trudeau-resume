            I am a programmer who loves to learn from and contribute to projects of all shapes and sizes! I am very open and creative when it comes to ideas. My intention when it comes to working with any group or company is to effectively play my part as a developer in a team environment. I am supportive and work well with all types of people. I love organization and honestly can't stand confusion or messes (inside and outside of programming). I see the importance in planning and staying on track as well as showing up for myself and others.
            <br/>I have tried many different styles of programming languages and have participated in and am familiar with agile workflow. My experiences with a web-development bootcamp and university projects allow me to be caught up with modern development tools. I am excited about being around like-minded passionate individuals to learn from each other.
